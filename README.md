# TemperatureMonitor
A simple console Java application intended for body temperature recording.

Data about date, time and temperature value for each measure is recorded into a file on user's desktop.

2. Remaining time show rate (in seconds): each user-defined number of seconds, a message will appear in console showing how long you still need to wait.

There is an option of showing temperature statistics: an average temperature during morning, afternoon, evening and night separately, as well as total average temperature measured.
